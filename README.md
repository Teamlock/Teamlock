TeamLock
===================================

TeamLock is a passwords manager for Enterprises. 

### Security

To manage the security of passwords, this app uses two different encryption mecanism:
- Asymetric encryption with RSA
- Symetric encryption

When a user is created, a mail is sent to allow him to configurate his account. He will have to choose a password for login and for asymetric key generation.

Once all the password are saved, the app will encrypt the database with a symetric key.
Then, the symetric key is encrypted using the user public key.
